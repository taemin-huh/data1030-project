This project aims to predict Pokemon battle win rates with ML models (multiple linear regression, SVM, decision tree, random foerst and XGBoost). The pipeline consists of EDA, preprocessing, tuning models, then evaluating performance using MAE. Splitting/non-deterministic uncertainties and global/local feature importances were also assessed.

Following Python and package versions were used:
- Python: 3.9
- pandas: 1.21.2
- sklearn: 0.24.2
- xgboost: 1.4.2
- matplotlib: 3.4.3
- shap: 0.39.0
